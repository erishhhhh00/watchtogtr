## 🚀 Push to GitHub - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `watch-with-friends`
3. **Description:** `Watch With Friends - Aahana 💖 DEEP Together - Real-time synchronized video watching`

   - ⭕ Public (anyone can see it)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### Step 2: Connect and Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/watch-with-friends.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username!**

---

## 📝 Quick Copy-Paste Commands:

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd C:\Users\ErISHHH\Desktop\Watchtogtr

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/watch-with-friends.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
